          ## Analysis Strategy

          ### Phase 1: Baseline Analysis
          - Repository analysis to establish current state
          - Code Maat analysis for historical patterns
          - Feature analysis for current structure

          ### Phase 2: Focused Analysis
          #{selected_areas.map { |area| "- #{area[:title]} analysis" }.join("\n")}

          ### Phase 3: Recommendations
          - Generate targeted recommendations for each focus area
          - Create action plan with priorities and timelines
          - Define success metrics for each area

          ## Next Steps

          1. Run `aidp analyze repository` to establish baseline
          2. Run focused analysis on selected areas
          3. Review and approve analysis results
          4. Implement recommended improvements
