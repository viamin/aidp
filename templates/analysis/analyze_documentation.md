### 2. Documentation Quality Assessment

- Evaluate readability and clarity of existing documentation
- Assess technical accuracy and completeness
- Review documentation structure and organization
- Analyze examples and code samples quality
- Evaluate documentation consistency and style

### 3. User Experience and Accessibility Analysis

- Assess documentation from different user perspectives (developers, users, maintainers)
- Evaluate information findability and navigation
- Analyze documentation accessibility and inclusivity
- Review documentation for different skill levels
- Assess multilingual and internationalization needs

### 4. Information Architecture Review

- Evaluate documentation structure and hierarchy
- Assess cross-referencing and linking between documents
- Analyze documentation searchability and indexing
- Review documentation metadata and tagging
- Evaluate documentation versioning and change management

### 5. Tooling and Automation Assessment

- Review documentation generation tools and processes
- Assess documentation maintenance workflows
- Evaluate documentation testing and validation
- Analyze documentation deployment and distribution
- Review documentation metrics and analytics

### 6. Gap Analysis and Prioritization

- Identify critical documentation gaps by impact and urgency
- Prioritize documentation needs based on user importance
- Assess documentation debt and technical debt relationship
- Evaluate documentation ROI and business value
- Identify quick wins and long-term documentation strategy

   - Resource and timeline estimates

### Secondary Output: Documentation Gaps Document

Create a document that includes:

- Detailed list of missing documentation
- Priority matrix for documentation needs
- User impact assessment for each gap
- Implementation recommendations and timelines

## Analysis Guidelines

- **User-Centric**: Focus on user needs and experience
- **Comprehensive**: Consider all types of users and use cases
- **Actionable**: Provide specific, implementable recommendations
- **Prioritized**: Focus on high-impact improvements first
- **Sustainable**: Consider long-term maintenance and evolution

## Questions to Ask (if needed)

If you need more information to complete the analysis, ask about:

- Target users and their documentation needs
- Project goals and success metrics
- Documentation budget and resources
- Team expertise and documentation skills
- Integration with development workflows
- Documentation standards and guidelines
- Internationalization requirements
- Accessibility requirements and standards

## Tools and Techniques

- **Content Audit**: Systematic review of all documentation
- **User Journey Mapping**: Map user paths through documentation
- **Gap Analysis**: Compare existing vs. needed documentation
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate documentation effectiveness
- **Information Architecture**: Assess structure and organization

## Documentation Types to Consider

- **API Documentation**: Endpoints, parameters, responses, examples
- **Setup and Installation**: Getting started guides, environment setup
- **User Guides**: How-to guides, tutorials, walkthroughs
- **Developer Documentation**: Architecture, code examples, contribution guides
- **Reference Documentation**: Complete API references, configuration options
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues, error messages, solutions
- **Release Notes**: Changes, migrations, deprecations
- **Architecture Documentation**: System design, data models, workflows

## Quality Indicators
