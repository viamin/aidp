## Analysis Guidelines

- **Quality-Focused**: Prioritize test quality over mere coverage numbers
- **Business-Critical**: Focus on testing critical business logic and user flows
- **Maintainable**: Assess tests for long-term maintainability and readability
- **Actionable**: Provide specific, implementable improvement suggestions
- **Comprehensive**: Consider all types of testing (unit, integration, e2e)

## Questions to Ask (if needed)

If you need more information to complete the analysis, ask about:

- Business criticality of different code paths
- User-facing features and workflows
- Error handling requirements and edge cases
- Integration points and external dependencies
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Team testing expertise and preferences
- CI/CD pipeline and testing automation
- Testing budget and time constraints

## Tools and Techniques

- **Coverage Analysis**: Use coverage tools to measure test coverage
- **Test Execution**: Run tests to assess reliability and performance
- **Code Review**: Manual analysis of test code quality
- **Dependency Analysis**: Identify integration points requiring testing
- **Business Logic Mapping**: Map critical business logic to test coverage

## Coverage Metrics to Consider

- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of code lines executed by tests
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of code branches executed by tests
- **Function Coverage**: Percentage of functions called by tests
- **Statement Coverage**: Percentage of statements executed by tests
- **Condition Coverage**: Percentage of boolean expressions evaluated
- **Path Coverage**: Percentage of possible execution paths tested

## Test Quality Indicators

- **Test Readability**: Clear, descriptive test names and structure
- **Test Maintainability**: Easy to update and modify tests
- **Test Isolation**: Tests don't depend on each other
- **Test Reliability**: Tests produce consistent results
- **Test Performance**: Tests execute quickly and efficiently
- **Test Documentation**: Clear understanding of what each test validates

Remember: Your analysis should focus on improving the overall quality and reliability of the codebase through better testing. Provide insights that will help the team build more robust, maintainable, and reliable software through effective testing practices.
