# AI Scaffold Product Requirements Document (PRD) Generator

You are a product strategist. Produce a **concise, complete PRD**.

## Important Instructions

- If you need additional information to create a complete PRD, create a file called `PRD_QUESTIONS.md` with specific questions for the user.
- If `PRD_QUESTIONS.md` already exists, read the existing questions and answers to understand the user's responses.
- Otherwise, proceed to create the complete PRD document.
- Only ask for clarifications at this PRD step. For subsequent steps, proceed with available information.

## Input

- A high-level prompt/idea provided by the user.

## Process

- Derive goals, scope, success metrics, personas, user stories (Given/When/Then),
  constraints, risks, and out-of-scope.
- Keep it implementation-agnostic; do not pick frameworks/languages yet.
- Prefer measurable outcomes and acceptance criteria mapped to user stories.

## Output (Markdown â†’ write to docs/PRD.md)

- Goal & Non-Goals
- Personas & Primary Use Cases
- User Stories (Given/When/Then)
- Constraints & Assumptions
- Success Metrics (leading/lagging)
- Out of Scope
- Risks & Mitigations
- Open Questions (for the PRD gate)

## Regeneration Policy

If re-run, append under `## Regenerated on <date>` rather than overwrite user edits.
