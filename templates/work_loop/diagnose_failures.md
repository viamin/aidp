# Diagnose Recent Failures

You are operating inside the Aidp work loop. Analyze the most recent deterministic failures and decide how to unblock progress. Finish by emitting `NEXT_UNIT: <unit_name>` on its own line.

## Recent Deterministic Outputs

## Instructions

- Identify the concrete failures and hypothesize root causes.
- Propose the next best action (run another deterministic unit, resume agentic editing, or wait for GitHub updates).
- Keep the analysis crisp—focus on evidence and required follow-up work.
