# Code Quality Plan

This plan captures the current tooling landscape and proposes next steps for keeping the codebase healthy. Generated by `aidp init` on 2025-10-16T14:54:28Z.

## Local Quality Toolchain
| Tool | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| Rspec | config |

## Immediate Actions
- Maintain current linting thresholds while documenting exceptions.
- Keep legacy style deviations documented until dedicated refactors are scheduled.
- Document onboarding steps in `docs/` to ensure future contributors follow the agreed workflow.

## Long-Term Improvements
- Keep the style guide in sync with real-world code changes; regenerate with `aidp init` after major rewrites.
- Automate test and lint runs via CI (detected: yes).
- Track flaky tests or unstable tooling in `PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md` under a “Health Log” section.
