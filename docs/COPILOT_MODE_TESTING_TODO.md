# Copilot Mode Flow Test Coverage TODO List

## Overview

This document outlines the testing requirements to achieve 90% test coverage for all classes involved in the AIDP copilot mode flow. Each class must meet both coverage requirements AND adhere to the LLM_STYLE_GUIDE testing principles.

## Testing Requirements

- **Target Coverage**: 90% line coverage minimum
- **Style Adherence**: Follow LLM_STYLE_GUIDE.md testing patterns
- **Test Types**: Unit tests with proper dependency injection, no `any_instance_of` mocking
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock external boundaries only (network, filesystem, user input)

## Class Testing TODO List

### ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY - Core Flow Classes

#### 1. `Aidp::CLI` (lib/aidp/cli.rb)

- **Current Status**: Expanded spec now at `spec/aidp/cli_spec.rb` (244 examples)
- **Current Coverage**: 87.15% (1146/1315 lines) – strong progress toward 90% target (need 38 more lines)
- **Completed Core Tasks**:
  - [x] Add tests for `CLI.run(ARGV)` main entry point (help, version, config, copilot startup, cancelled setup, forced setup)
  - [x] Test `subcommand?(args)` with all supported subcommands (+ negative cases)
  - [x] Test `parse_options(args)` (help, version, setup-config, multiple flags, baseline parser inclusion, **invalid option errors**)
  - [x] Test `setup_logging(project_dir)` (present config, missing file, malformed YAML, missing logging key, warning on failure, **logger raise rescue**)
  - [x] Test copilot mode startup flow (guided workflow selection, harness run success path)
  - [x] Test error handling (Interrupt & StandardError in workflow selection and harness runner)
  - [x] Test TUI component lifecycle (start/stop loop under success, interrupt, error)
  - [x] Integration-style harness invocation without interactive prompts (dependency injection & stubbing)
  - [x] Ensure dependency injection for `TTY::Prompt` (create_prompt stubbed in specs; TestPrompt usage)
  - [x] Branch coverage for: execute, work, skill (list/show/search/preview/validate/delete/new minimal), init, watch, checkpoint (show/summary/history/metrics/clear), providers (health & refresh & **--no-color**), mcp (dashboard/check), workstreams (parallel run/run-all/dashboard/bulk pause/resume/stop)
  - [x] **Checkpoint watch loop**: summary --watch with Interrupt handling (no sleep stubbing anti-pattern)
  - [x] **Providers info command**: usage, nil info error, rich display with MCP/flags/capabilities
  - [x] **Issue import command**: help, URL/number/shorthand import, missing identifier, unknown subcommand
  - [x] **Config command**: help, unknown option error, interactive wizard without dry-run
  - [x] **Workstream edge cases**: list empty, new invalid slug, new with base-branch, Worktree::Error rescue, rm declined/force, status missing/nonexistent/git status invocation, run no slugs, run-all no active, unknown subcommand
  - [x] **Execute command precedence**: reset vs approve, non-PRD step, analyze PRD step, **background --follow success/timeout**
  - [x] **Helper extraction**: extract_interval_option, extract_mode_option, get_binary_name mappings, class-level display_harness_result
  - [x] **Skills preview inheritance**: "(template)" and "(inherits from template)" branches
  - [x] **Checkpoint metrics boolean edge**: false values behavior documented (potential bug identified)
  - [x] **Skill diff command**: template vs project, no template found, template skill warning, missing id
  - [x] **Skill edit command**: template override notice, --dry-run/--open-editor parsing, unknown option error
  - [x] **Skill validate with path**: valid file, invalid format (ValidationError)
  - [x] **Skill new full workflow**: --id, --name, --from-template, --clone, --yes options, unknown option rejection
  - [x] **Workstream parallel run**: missing slugs error, success message, partial failure warning, error handling
  - [x] **Workstream run-all**: no active workstreams warning, success display, error handling
  - [x] **KB command**: show with topic, default summary topic, usage for unknown/missing subcommand
  - [x] **Harness command**: status display, reset with/without mode flag, usage for unknown subcommand
  - [x] **extract_mode_option edge cases**: equals form, separate token, missing mode, mode followed by flag

### ❌ LOW PRIORITY - Utility Classes (Still Need 90%)

#### 9. TTY Components Integration

- **TODO Tasks**:
  - [ ] Verify all TTY::Prompt mocking follows style guide
  - [ ] Ensure no direct TTY component instantiation in tests
  - [ ] Test all display_message usage patterns
  - [ ] Create shared test helpers for TTY mocking

## Style Guide Compliance Audit

### ❌ Critical Style Guide Violations to Fix

#### 1. Mock Strategy Audit

- [ ] **Scan all existing specs for `any_instance_of` usage - ELIMINATE ALL**
- [ ] **Verify all external boundaries properly mocked**:
  - [ ] Network calls (AI providers)
  - [ ] File system operations
  - [ ] User input (TTY::Prompt)
  - [ ] Terminal I/O
- [ ] **Ensure constructor dependency injection used throughout**

#### 2. Test Organization Audit  

- [ ] **Verify test descriptions are behavior-focused** (not implementation-focused)
- [ ] **Check that tests focus on public API only** (no private method testing)
- [ ] **Ensure proper test isolation** (no shared state between tests)
- [ ] **Verify proper cleanup in ensure blocks** where needed

#### 3. Pending Specs Policy

- [ ] **Audit all pending specs** - ensure they follow pending policy
- [ ] **No pending regressions allowed** - fix or remove features
- [ ] **All pending specs must have issue references**

## Coverage Measurement Plan

### Phase 1: Baseline Measurement

- [ ] Run full test suite with coverage: `bundle exec rspec --require spec_helper`
- [ ] Generate coverage report and identify current coverage per class
- [ ] Document current coverage gaps for each class

### Phase 2: Targeted Testing

- [ ] Prioritize classes with 0% coverage (EnhancedWorkflowSelector)
- [ ] Focus on core flow classes (CLI, GuidedAgent, EnhancedRunner)
- [ ] Ensure each class reaches 90%+ before moving to next

### Phase 3: Integration Testing

- [ ] Add end-to-end flow tests using expect scripts (not interactive)
- [ ] Test complete copilot mode flow with mocked user input
- [ ] Verify error recovery and edge cases in full flow

## Newly Identified Gaps & Additional TODOs (Oct 24 2025)

### High Priority Additions (Stability / Determinism / Remaining Coverage)

- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: CLI Providers info negative capability + permission modes tests added
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: Logger fallback path when file creation fails (Kernel.warn + STDERR fallback) tested
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: Logger redaction tests (message and metadata patterns, JSON format, known limitation documented)
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: Workstream system specs performance optimization (27.97s → 13.41s via test adapter)
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: ProviderManager binary timeout branch (process kill + timeout reason verified)
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: ProviderManager binary_missing branch (which returns nil → binary_missing reason)
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: ProviderManager: binary_missing with subsequent availability recovery after TTL expiration
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: EnhancedRunner: full `run` loop with pause condition triggered mid-step (should_pause? + handle_pause_condition)
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: EnhancedRunner: thread cleanup verification (no lingering threads after run completes) – count Thread.list delta
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: EnhancedRunner: error recovery path (simulate step exception -> recovery or termination depending on policy)
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: WorkLoopRunner (fix-forward): repeated FAIL cycles exhausting NEXT_PATCH iterations edge (ensure termination state and summary counts)
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: Sticky session expiry edge: test session timeout boundary (session removed after @session_timeout + epsilon)
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: Rate limit next_reset_time with multiple providers – assert earliest future reset chosen
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: Health dashboard: duplicate normalized providers merge with mixed statuses (auth + circuit_breaker_open precedence)
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: Circuit breaker combined scenario: provider AND model breaker opening then timed reset (time travel)
- [ ] Health dashboard: macos hidden but still contributes merged metrics when others share normalized name (none currently – add synthetic?)

### Medium Priority (Observability / Performance / UX)

- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: Performance scaling with large provider list (50+ entries) ensuring O(n) complexity without quadratic behavior
- [x] **✅ COMPLETED**: JSON logging format: comprehensive tests for format_json branch including success and error cases with metadata redaction
- [ ] Display helpers: time formatting edge cases (sub-second, >24h, leap second simulation) – confirm formatting stability
- [ ] MessageDisplay: multiple consecutive muted/info/error calls ensure no shared state contamination
- [ ] MCP dashboard filtering variations (if filter args or modes exist) – confirm counts and hidden providers logic
- [ ] KB command unknown topic suggestion list (if implementation supports suggestions) – negative path test
- [ ] CLI watch command additional error branch: invalid interval token, negative interval
- [ ] Init command option matrix: conflicting flags, missing required directory, permission error rescue
- [ ] Work command inline harness launch path with unsupported mode – assert graceful error

### Low Priority (Polish / Hardening)

- [ ] Concurrency stress: simultaneous provider + model switches (race-free health updates) – use threads and join
- [ ] Resource leak audit: ensure no file handles remain open after logger STDERR fallback
- [ ] Binary availability cache TTL expiry test: force time advance and re-check invocation count
- [ ] TTY shared helper: introduce spec support module to standardize prompt + output stubbing
- [ ] Pending specs audit: confirm each pending has issue reference tag / remove stale pendings
- [ ] Redaction list extensibility: add test ensuring adding a new sensitive key updates both text and JSON formats

### Test Infrastructure Enhancements

- [ ] Introduce TimeTravel helper (freeze + advance) for circuit breaker / rate limit / session expiry tests
- [ ] Introduce ConcurrencyHelper for deterministic thread sequencing (barrier + join)
- [ ] Shared LoggerFactory test double to avoid real file writes across specs
- [ ] Central ProviderManager factory with deterministic CLI availability overrides

### Ordering for Next Implementation Cycle

1. CLI providers negative capability + permission modes
2. Logger fallback + redaction
3. ProviderManager binary timeout / missing paths
4. EnhancedRunner run loop pause & cleanup
5. WorkLoopRunner failure exhaustion
6. Sticky session expiry & rate limit earliest reset
7. Health dashboard merge precedence
8. Remaining medium-priority UX and performance cases

### Acceptance Criteria Additions

- Each new behavioral branch gains at least one assertion on both state and side-effect (log entry, history record)
- Time-based tests use TimeTravel helper; avoid real sleep
- Concurrency tests assert deterministic outcomes (no flaky ordering)
- No real external binaries spawned – all binary checks stubbed where not explicitly under test

---
Tracking above should push CLI and remaining partial areas over 90% while raising robustness for production failure modes.
