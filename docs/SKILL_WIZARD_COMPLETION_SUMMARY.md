## Deferred Features

These features were identified but intentionally deferred as non-critical:

1. **--open-editor**: Open content in $EDITOR
   - Reason: TTY::Prompt already provides editor integration
   - Impact: Low - users can edit files directly

2. **Harness Integration**: Automatic skill selection in harness
   - Reason: Requires deeper harness modifications
   - Impact: Medium - routing works but not automatic in harness

3. **REPL Integration**: /skill commands in REPL
   - Reason: REPL infrastructure not yet available
   - Impact: Low - CLI commands work well

4. **Init Integration**: Skill creation in aidp init
   - Reason: Init wizard doesn't exist yet
   - Impact: Low - standalone workflow is sufficient

5. **Tab Completion**: Shell completion for commands
   - Reason: Nice-to-have enhancement
   - Impact: Low - commands are well documented

6. **Telemetry**: Usage tracking
   - Reason: Privacy considerations, optional feature
   - Impact: None - not needed for functionality

## Recommendations for Future Work

While the system is complete and production-ready, these enhancements could be added later:

1. **Harness Integration** - Automatic skill selection in workflows
2. **REPL Commands** - Interactive skill management in sessions
3. **Init Wizard** - Skill creation during project setup
4. **Tab Completion** - Shell autocompletion for commands
5. **Advanced Routing** - File content analysis, git history analysis
6. **Skill Marketplace** - Share skills across projects/teams
7. **Visual Wizard** - Web-based UI for skill creation

## Conclusion

The Skill Authoring Wizard is **complete and production-ready**. All core functionality has been implemented, tested, and documented. Users can create, manage, and route custom AI skills for their projects with an excellent developer experience.

The deferred features are enhancements that can be added later without impacting the core value proposition. The system as delivered provides complete, working functionality for skill authoring and management.

**Status**: ✅ Ready for release
