## Overview

Implement parallel workstream support in AIDP using git worktrees. This allows multiple AI agents to work concurrently on different tasks in isolated environments, each with their own branch and working directory.

## Motivation

- **Concurrency**: Enable multiple agents to work on different tasks simultaneously
- **Isolation**: Each workstream has its own git branch and working directory
- **Safety**: No conflicts between concurrent work - each agent operates independently
- **Productivity**: Users can queue multiple tasks and have them worked on in parallel

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Worktree Module** (`lib/aidp/worktree.rb`) - Low-level git worktree operations
2. **CLI Commands** (`lib/aidp/cli.rb`) - User-facing commands for managing workstreams
3. **REPL Integration** (`lib/aidp/repl.rb`) - Interactive workstream management in REPL
4. **Work Loop Integration** - Execute tasks in worktree context
5. **Watch Mode Integration** - Monitor and display parallel workstream status

### Data Model

9. âœ… Comprehensive test coverage (66.3% > 65.65% baseline, 80 workstream specs)
10. âœ… All code passes `bundle exec rake pc`

**Additional Achievements:**

- âœ… State manager tracks current workstream
- âœ… Watch mode builds in isolated workstreams by default

- âœ… Comprehensive user and technical documentation
- âœ… Proper error handling and validation
- âœ… Help output and command reference updated
- âœ… Legacy mode support (`--no-workstreams`)

## Technical Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Worktree Location**: Use `.worktrees/` subdirectory for consistency and easy cleanup
2. **Branch Naming**: Default to `aidp/{slug}` pattern for clarity
3. **State Isolation**: Each worktree has its own `.aidp/` directory
4. **Registry**: Centralized registry in main `.aidp/worktrees.json` for listing
5. **Error Strategy**: Raise specific errors, fail fast, log context

### Dependencies

- Git 2.5+ (for worktree support)
- TTY::Prompt (for interactive commands)
- TTY::Table (for formatted output)
- Existing REPL and work loop infrastructure

### Performance Considerations

- Worktree creation is fast (~100ms per worktree)
- State files are small JSON (~1KB each)
- No impact on main working directory
- Can support 10+ concurrent workstreams

### Security Considerations

- Validate slug format to prevent path traversal
- Use Git's native worktree validation
- Don't execute untrusted code in worktree creation
- Sanitize user input for task descriptions

## Migration & Rollout

1. **Phase 1 (Core)**: Low-level operations, no user-facing changes
2. **Phase 2 (CLI)**: Introduce CLI commands behind feature flag if needed
3. **Phase 3-4 (Integration)**: Gradual rollout with REPL and work loop
4. **Phase 5-6 (Polish)**: Documentation and watch mode enhancements

No breaking changes to existing functionality. All workstream features are additive.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should workstreams auto-clean after completion? Or keep for historical reference?
- [ ] Should we support workstream templates (pre-configured task types)?
- [ ] Should watch mode be the default when multiple workstreams are active?
- [ ] Should we add workstream priority/ordering?
