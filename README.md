# AI Dev Pipeline (aidp) - Ruby Gem

![Coverage](./badges/coverage.svg)

A portable CLI that automates AI development workflows from idea to implementation using your existing IDE assistants. Features autonomous work loops, background execution, and comprehensive progress tracking.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the gem
gem install aidp

# Navigate to your project
cd /your/project

# Launch the interactive configuration wizard
aidp config --interactive

# Analyze and bootstrap project docs
aidp init
# Creates LLM_STYLE_GUIDE.md, PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md, CODE_QUALITY_PLAN.md

# Start Copilot interactive mode (default)
aidp
```

### First-Time Setup

On the first run in a project without an `aidp.yml`, AIDP launches a **First-Time Setup Wizard**. You'll be prompted to choose one of:

1. Minimal (single provider: cursor)
2. Development template (multiple providers, safe defaults)
3. Production template (full-feature example â€“ review before committing)
4. Full example (verbose documented config)
5. Custom (interactive prompts for providers and defaults)

Non-interactive environments (CI, scripts, pipes) automatically receive a minimal `aidp.yml` so workflows can proceed without manual intervention.

You can re-run the wizard manually:

```bash
aidp --setup-config
```

## Core Features

### Work Loops

AIDP implements **work loops** - an iterative execution pattern where AI agents autonomously work on tasks until completion, with automatic testing and linting feedback.

- **Iterative refinement**: Agent works in loops until task is 100% complete
- **Self-management**: Agent edits PROMPT.md to track its own progress
- **Automatic validation**: Tests and linters run after each iteration
- **Self-correction**: Only failures are fed back for the next iteration

See [Work Loops Guide](docs/WORK_LOOPS_GUIDE.md) for details.

### Job Management

Monitor and control background jobs:

```bash
# List and manage jobs
aidp jobs list                        # List all jobs
aidp jobs status <job_id>             # Show job status
aidp jobs logs <job_id> --tail        # View recent logs
aidp checkpoint summary --watch       # Watch metrics in real-time

# Control jobs
aidp jobs stop <job_id>               # Stop a running job
```

### Progress Checkpoints

Track code quality metrics and task progress throughout execution:

```bash
# View current progress
aidp checkpoint summary

# Watch with auto-refresh
aidp checkpoint summary --watch

# View historical data
aidp checkpoint history 20
```

**Tracked Metrics:**

- Lines of code
- Test coverage
- Code quality scores
- PRD task completion percentage
- File count and growth trends

### Parallel Workstreams

Work on multiple tasks simultaneously using isolated git worktrees:

```bash
# Create a workstream for each task
aidp ws new issue-123-fix-auth
aidp ws new feature-dashboard

# List all workstreams
aidp ws list

# Check status
aidp ws status issue-123-fix-auth

# Remove when complete
aidp ws rm issue-123-fix-auth --delete-branch
```

**Benefits:**

- Complete isolation between tasks
- Separate git branches for each workstream
- Independent state and history
- Work on multiple features in parallel

See [Workstreams Guide](docs/WORKSTREAMS.md) for detailed usage.

```

## AI Providers

AIDP intelligently manages multiple providers with automatic switching:

- **Anthropic Claude CLI** - Primary provider for complex analysis and code generation
- **Codex CLI** - OpenAI's Codex command-line interface for code generation
- **Cursor CLI** - IDE-integrated provider for code-specific tasks
- **Gemini CLI** - Google's Gemini command-line interface for general tasks
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** - GitHub's AI pair programmer command-line interface
- **macOS UI** - macOS-specific UI automation provider
- **OpenCode** - Alternative open-source code generation provider

The system automatically switches providers when:

- Rate limits are hit
- Providers fail or timeout
- Cost limits are reached
- Performance optimization is needed

### Provider Configuration

```yaml
# aidp.yml
harness:
  work_loop:
    enabled: true
    max_iterations: 50
    test_commands:
      - "bundle exec rspec"
    lint_commands:
      - "bundle exec standardrb"
    units:
      deterministic:
        - name: run_full_tests
          command: "bundle exec rake spec"
          enabled: false
          next:
            success: agentic
            failure: decide_whats_next
        - name: wait_for_github
          type: "wait"
          metadata:

export AIDP_GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
```

## Tree-sitter Static Analysis

AIDP includes powerful Tree-sitter-based static analysis capabilities for code.

### Tree-sitter Dependencies

The Tree-sitter analysis requires the Tree-sitter system library and pre-compiled language parsers:

```bash
# Install Tree-sitter system library
# macOS
brew install tree-sitter

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install tree-sitter

# Or follow the ruby_tree_sitter README for other platforms
# https://github.com/Faveod/ruby-tree-sitter#installation

# Install Tree-sitter parsers
./install_tree_sitter_parsers.sh
```

### Parser Installation Script

The `install_tree_sitter_parsers.sh` script automatically downloads and installs pre-built Tree-sitter parsers:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x install_tree_sitter_parsers.sh

# Run the installation script
./install_tree_sitter_parsers.sh
```

The script will:

- Detect your OS and architecture (macOS ARM64, Linux x64, etc.)
- Download the appropriate parser bundle from [Faveod/tree-sitter-parsers](https://github.com/Faveod/tree-sitter-parsers/releases/tag/v4.9)
- Extract parsers to `.aidp/parsers/` directory
- Set up the `TREE_SITTER_PARSERS` environment variable

### Environment Setup

After running the installation script, make the environment variable permanent:

```bash
# Add to your shell profile (e.g., ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc)
echo 'export TREE_SITTER_PARSERS="$(pwd)/.aidp/parsers"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload your shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Knowledge Base Structure

The Tree-sitter analysis generates structured JSON files in `.aidp/kb/`:

- **`symbols.json`** - Classes, modules, methods, and their metadata
- **`imports.json`** - Require statements and dependencies
- **`calls.json`** - Method calls and invocation patterns
- **`metrics.json`** - Code complexity and size metrics
- **`seams.json`** - Integration points and dependency injection opportunities
- **`hotspots.json`** - Frequently changed code areas (based on git history)
- **`tests.json`** - Test coverage analysis
- **`cycles.json`** - Circular dependency detection

### Legacy Code Analysis Features

The Tree-sitter analysis specifically supports:

- **Seam Detection**: Identifies I/O operations, global state access, and constructor dependencies
- **Change Hotspots**: Uses git history to identify frequently modified code
- **Dependency Analysis**: Maps import relationships and call graphs
- **Test Coverage**: Identifies untested public APIs
- **Refactoring Opportunities**: Suggests dependency injection points and seam locations

## File-Based Interaction

At gate steps, the AI creates files for interaction instead of requiring real-time chat:

- **Questions files**: `PRD_QUESTIONS.md`, `ARCH_QUESTIONS.md`, `TASKS_QUESTIONS.md`, `IMPL_QUESTIONS.md` - Contains questions if AI needs more information
- **Output files**: `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/Architecture.md` - Review and edit as needed
- **Progress tracking**: `.aidp-progress.yml` - Tracks completion status

### Answering Questions

When the AI creates a questions file, follow these steps:

1. **Edit the file directly**: Add your answers below each question in the file
2. **Re-run the step**: The AI will read your answers and complete the step
3. **Approve when satisfied**: Mark the step complete and continue

The questions file is only created when the AI needs additional information beyond what it can infer from your project structure and existing files. Your answers are preserved for future reference.

## Workflow Examples

### Standard Interactive Workflow

```bash
# Start Copilot mode (default)
aidp

# Copilot will guide you through:
# - Understanding your project goals
# - Selecting the right workflow (analysis, development, or both)
# - Answering questions about your requirements
# - Reviewing generated files (PRD, architecture, etc.)
# - Automatic execution with harness managing retries
```

### Project Analysis

```bash
# High-level project analysis and documentation
aidp init

# Creates:
# - LLM_STYLE_GUIDE.md
# - PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md
# - CODE_QUALITY_PLAN.md
```

### Progress Monitoring

```bash
# Watch progress in real-time
aidp checkpoint summary --watch

# Check job status
aidp jobs list
aidp checkpoint summary
```

## Debug and Logging

```bash
# Enable debug output to see AI provider communication
AIDP_DEBUG=1 aidp

# Log to a file for debugging
AIDP_LOG_FILE=aidp.log aidp

# Combine both for full debugging
AIDP_DEBUG=1 AIDP_LOG_FILE=aidp.log aidp
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Install Tree-sitter parsers for development
./install_tree_sitter_parsers.sh

# Set up environment variables
